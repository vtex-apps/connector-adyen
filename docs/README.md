This app integrates Adyen with VTEX checkout.

## Configuration

### Adyen Setup

Before you can configure the VTEX Adyen connector, you will need to do the following setup in your Adyen merchant account:

1. Generate Web Service API credentials.
   - Under the Developers tab, select `API credentials`
   - Select `Webservice`
   - Keep `Username` and `Password` somewhere safe
   - Generate a new API Key and store it somewhere safe. This can be regenerated if lost
2. (Do Only Once) Send an email to Adyen support (suporte@adyen.com), requesting the permissions listed in the model below:
   - Subject: Setting VTEX web-service user permissions for {accountName}
   - Email Body: Adyen Support, I send this email to ask you to grant the necessary permissions to the user username@Company.companyname so that it can be used on the VTEX platform. Thank you in advance!
3. In Merchant Settings, update the Capture Delay option to `manual`. This allows VTEX to handle payment capture timing.
4. Create a Standard Notification Webhook
   - Use `https://{accountName}.myvtex.com/_v/api/connector-adyen/v0/hook` for the URL
      - Example: `https://mysampleshop.myvtex.com/_v/api/connector-adyen/v0/hook`
   - Make sure `Service Version` is `1`
   - Make sure the webhook is marked as `active`
   - Make sure `Method` is set to `JSON`
   - Create a `username` and `password` of your choice for the webhook events
